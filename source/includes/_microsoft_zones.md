# Microsoft Zones

For all its Azure services, Microsoft uses a region that changes the API endpoints.
For instance, if the service is located in west europe the api endpoint is https://westeurope.api.cogntitive.microsoft.com

This is all the allowed zones in Azure to use Cognitive Services:

- westus
- westus2
- eastus
- eastus2
- westcentralus
- southcentralus
- westeurope
- northeurope
- southeastasia
- eastasia
- australiaeast
- brazilsouth
